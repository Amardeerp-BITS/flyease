# Project Title: FlyEase

## Group Number: 02

## Problem Statement
Despite the availability of several online travel booking platforms, many users still find the process of planning and booking trips to be fragmented, non-intuitive, and lacking personalization. Additionally, there is limited focus on promoting sustainable travel. There is a need for an innovative solution that simplifies travel planning, enhances user experience, integrates real-time data, and promotes responsible tourism through digital innovation.

## Project Description
FlyEase is an innovative travel booking platform designed to simplify and enhance the way users plan their journeys. Inspired by platforms like MakeMyTrip, FlyEase allows users to search, compare, and book flights and hotels through a seamless and intuitive interface. 

What sets FlyEase apart is its focus on user experience, personalization, and sustainability. The project aligns with **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure** by promoting digital innovation in the travel and tourism sector. In the future, FlyEase aims to support sustainable travel options, contributing to responsible tourism.

This project provides hands-on experience in:
- User authentication
- API integration
- Responsive UI/UX design
- Real-time data handling

It is a valuable and impactful project for aspiring developers.
